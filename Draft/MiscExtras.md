## The Nutrionist

We consume our news like gluttons. We gorge ourselves with the junk food of the newsroom - a new sex tape, or the newest celebrity spat. The scholar Danah Boyd chalks this up to our biology, saying that we're "programmed to be attentive to things that stimulate: content that is gross, violent, or sexual and that gossip which is humiliating, embarrassing, or offensive". Just like we crave fatty 

As
sociologist Danah Boyd said in a speech at the 2009 Web 2.0 Expo "Our
bodies are programmed to consume fat and sugars because they’re rare in nature.
In the same way, we’re biologically programmed to be attentive to things that
stimulate: content that is gross, violent, or sexual and that gossip which is
humiliating, embarrassing, or offensive. If we’re not careful, we’re going to
develop the psychological equivalent of obesity. We’ll find ourselves consuming
content that is least beneficial for ourselves or society as a whole."

SOLUTIONS

3	Conversation/friendship - non-religious communities being the starting point? Stories about the others day, their religious activity etc

We can then examine communication between these groups:

1	Polysemy theory means that there is a natural communication barrier (the word God, atheism as anti-religious, Christian "lumping" (no true Scotsman))

2	Specific group language (jargon)

3 Framing

##### Christian

Attempts to codify the beliefs of the Christian worldview have existed almost since the beginning of Christianity itself. Creeds are sets of beliefs that Christians agree on, and often recite together. The Apostles Creed is a common example, still being said by Christians today, Catholic and Protestant alike. The Old Roman Form was in use by the middle of the 2nd century, with the earliest written record from 341 AD INLCI. It reads as follows:

"I believe in God the Father Almighty. And in Jesus Christ his only (begotten) Son our Lord, who was born of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary; crucified under Pontius Pilate, and buried; the third day He rose from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. And in the Holy Ghost; the holy Church; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; (the life everlasting)." INLCI

This is then an urgent message to those Christians stuck in a bubble - get out! 

I could say this message to Christian hermits.

But also there are examples of Christian bubbles. 

There are also examples of Christian bubbles in online Christian culture.

The call then is to get out. Christians have been willing to do this (John Eliot, Hudson Taylor), going so far to die for the message. And even today, Christians do the same (CU, other examples)
